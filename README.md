# byte2jam

byte2jam is a novel way to store data. In the same way that a QR code encodes a
byte string into a machine-readable image, byte2jam encodes a byte string into
a so-called "jam" - a unique, ear-pleasing sequence of notes that can be read
back into the original byte string. byte2jam is written in Python 3 and
supports encoding any type that can be read as a bytearray, with a MIDI output
corresponding to the generated song.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
